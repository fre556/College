Difference between awt and swing

Both awt and swing are libraries imported into a program when the programmer needs to use features from them.
 But swing proceeded awt. awt came first.it allowed the user to rely on prebuilt libraries to implement some 
of the architecture of the coding.but is caused inconsistancies depending on the platform implementing the program. 
It was a heavyweight library relying on pre rendering all components.

Swing countered this by creating a lightweight set of components. It also removed several of the inconsistancies 
found in awt.It also implemented some brand new features that were unavailable with awt. With swings lightweight 
components and new features it has done a great deal to replace awt. although it is worth noting that certain features, 
mainly containers, still rely on awt to work.
